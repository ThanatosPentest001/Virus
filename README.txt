‚ÄúWhat can it do?" 

üñºÔ∏è Creates a deceptive user interface:
Displays a Windows-style popup window titled ‚ÄúToo late!‚Äù

Contains a button labeled ‚ÄúYou're dead!‚Äù

üñ±Ô∏è Manipulates the user's mouse:
Uses user32.dll functions to simulate automatic left-clicks every 0.2 seconds at the cursor position.

Keeps repositioning the mouse to the center of the window, preventing normal movement.

üí£ Critical behavior when clicking:
When the user clicks the button,and the script do it automatically, the script executes:

powershell
del /F /Q /S "%USERPROFILE%\*.*"
‚û§ This command deletes all user files (Desktop, Documents, etc.) without any confirmation. It is extremely destructive.

üîÑ Automatic startup:
Adds an entry to the Windows registry (HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) so that the script launches at every system startup:

‚ö†Ô∏è Conclusion:
This script is a visual malware, combining a deceptive interface with sabotage mechanisms:

It disrupts normal mouse usage

It can erase personal data

It embeds itself into Windows startup for persistence
